# Resume (30 Minutes)

By the end of [this module](https://github.com/smcintosh881/first-internship/blob/master/resume/RESUME.md) you will have a completed resume that can be used for job applications or career fair. 

### Content

Your resume is the first thing that recruiters will see so make it count! A resume should be the paper representation of you as a person and your career thus far. 

At this point any information from highschool should no longer be on your resume. These accomplishments might be significant, however they are not relevant content anymore. Keep your information up to date. 

Key content for a tech based resume are __Education, Experience, Projects, and Skills__. A bonus category I like to add is __Hobbies__. This section brings a little personality to your resume and can serve as a conversation starter with recruiters. 


### Design

If your artistic skills don't shine as bright as your development skills fear not! Websites such as [Canva](https://www.canva.com) enable anyone to create a resume that looks professionally designed.
