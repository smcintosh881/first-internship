# Resume (30 Minutes)

By the end of this module you will have a completed resume that can be used for job applications or career fair. 
Checkout my presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12rxK14GFmhHbWh_abrOBQkjJGP4qVOajPsXMAQiC_-o/edit?usp=sharing).

### Content

Your resume is the first thing that recruiters will see so make it count! A resume should be the paper representation of you as a person and your career thus far. 

At this point any information from highschool should no longer be on your resume (with a few expections). These accomplishments might be significant, however they might not relevant content. Keep your information up to date.

If you have a long standing volunteer experince, or cool project that you are passionate about its good to have these as conversation pieces with recruiters, however only include if you need a little bit more for your resume. 

Key content for a tech based resume are __Education, Experience, Projects, and Skills__. A bonus category I like to add is __Hobbies__. This section brings a little personality to your resume and can serve as a conversation starter with recruiters. 

### Objective
There are debates whether or not you should have an objective section. Should you need a little bit more content to cover the page or desire to clarify what you are looking for add a little personal statement. If your resume is going to be handed out at career fairs where you talk directly to a recruiter there isn't a huge need and online applications typically ask for a cover letter. 

### Contact Information
Be sure to list your email and phone number so recruiters can contact you. Put this at the top and easy to see! It is recomended to add links to either [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com). The later is especially important if you have a personal website or personal projects linked to that GitHub account.

### Education
For this section include information about your college and the program you are in. 

	Rochester Institute of Technology
	
	BS Software Engineering
	
	Minor Cyber Security
	
	2014-2019
	
The key information to include here is the name of your college, the program, degree type (ie Bachelors or Science), start and graduation date. This is important for companies when they are looking for interns vs fulltime hires. 

Another bit of informatio to include would be any minors your are pursing or if you are enrolled as a BS/MS student. 

### Experience 
Chances are you might not have had relevant experience to the job you are applying to. This section can be difficult to fill in. Here are some suggestions:

1. Course Assistant experience 
2. Volunteer for computing based inititives 
3. Membership in computing related clubs on campus
4. Hackathons
5. Projects (if you do not have any checkout the [Projects Module]())

### Skills
Here is the area where you can highlight your technical skills. Most likely this will consist of one or two languages and possibly a framework. Some examples are:

1. Python
2. Java
3. Javascript
4. React
5. Git (version control)
6. HTML/CSS

It's important to let recruiters know how proficent you are in these skills. In the provided example resume skill section there are dots to represent which skills you are best at. 


### Next Steps
Now its time for you to give it a go! If you want some help with design/layout [this website](https://www.canva.com) offers an online editor with templates (the [provided example](https://github.com/smcintosh881/first-internship/blob/master/resume/example.pdf) was created using this tool). Another option is to used [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) and export it as PDF. 

Checkout the the [provided example](https://github.com/smcintosh881/first-internship/blob/master/resume/example.pdf) of a first year student at RIT to see what your resume could look like.
