# First Internship
This is a how to guide on landing an internship at Facebook, Google, or Microsoft in your 1st-2nd year.
This will be broken down into three different modules Resume, Projects, and Interview to guide you through the process. 

## What are these programs?
Many tech companies are beginning to offer internship programs specifcally designed for first and second year students. They focus on developing your technical skills as well as exposing you to how industry works and the general software development process. These programs look for students that are excited to work at the company and are passionate about software development. These internships are essentially the same as regular Software Engineer internships, except they focus more on developing your skills and providing mentorship. 

### First hand experience
We've had a couple of members from the RIT community that have participated in these programs before.

Hey guys. I was in your spot once, a 1st/2nd year, and honestly did not think I would ever make it to any of the big 5 tech companies. Yet, here I am after my second year and first co-op working for Microsoft wishing I had applied for one of the underclassman programs as a Freshman. As an Explorer at Microsoft, I had the opportunity to work with the Universal Outlook team to create a project that would help make sure that people who left store reviews of Mail and Calendar, were being heard. Overall, I had a fantastic time working there and learning about what it is like working for a big tech company and explore the west coast as well. Overall, the application process was as simple as applying. I had friends from RIT who also interned with me that met recruiters at events Microsoft had hosted and at the career fair. The interview itself is a little scary (As they usually are and that’s okay), but overall it was a good experience to have. They will not turn you away because you are so young, they will want to talk to you because of the programs that exist for underclassmen. I learned a lot this summer about the tech industry and about my own passion for technology, and you should do the same. What do you have to lose? There is so much time ahead to do internships and co-ops, that even if it doesn’t go well, these companies are more than willing to try again later, and you now have some interview experiance to learn from. So go for it :grinning:
